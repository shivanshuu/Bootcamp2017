# Bootcamp2017

Enterprise Ready Cloud
In this hackathon, you are working with Trey Research to setup some best practices regarding policies, permissions, and remote access to their network. Some tasks will include creating scripts that Enterprise IT will use to automatically set policy and delegate permissions when a new subscription is created. You will also help them solve a critical problem for onboarding new developers and controlling access to what they can access on the network. 

Building a Resilient IaaS Architecture 
Contoso has asked you to deploy their infrastructure in a resilient manner to attain an SLA from Microsoft. 

Enterprise Class Networking
The Enterprise-class Networking in Azure Hackathon is a hands-on exercise that will challenge you to implement an end-to-end scenario using hybrid and core virtual networking technologies available in Azure

Azure Resource Manager
Contoso has asked you to define an Azure Resource Manager template that can deploy their application CloudShop and its associated database using Azure Virtual Machines. 

Optimized Architecture
The Optimized Architecture Hackathon is a hands-on exercise that will challenge you to calculate Azure spending optimizations by comparing IaaS and PaaS services using a supplied sample application (a 3-tier application written in C# and ASP.NET MVC) that is based on Microsoft Azure IaaS services such as Virtual Machines, Virtual Network, Load Balancers, Storage and SQL Database. In addition to calculating estimated Azure cost of the existing architecture, you will need to calculate the estimated cost of hosting the sample application using Azure PaaS services. The scenario will include migrating the full sample application to be hosted on Azure PaaS services such as Azure App Service Web Apps, Web Jobs, and Traffic Manager, as well as implementing a secondary hosting region for the Web App tier and database replication.

Agile continuous delivery 
Contoso has asked you to automate their development process in two specific ways. First, they want you to define an Azure Resource Manager template that can deploy their application into the Microsoft Azure cloud using Platform-as-a-Service technology for their web application and their SQL database. Second, they want you to implement a continuous delivery process that will connect their source code repository into the cloud, automatically run their code changes through unit tests, and then automatically create new software builds and deploy them onto environment-specific deployment slots so that each branch of code can be tested and accessed independently.. 

OSS DevOps
The OSS DevOps Hackathon is a hands-on exercise that will challenge you to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Microsoft Azure App Services and related services.  The scenario will challenge you to setup continuous integration and delivery of the application.  

Modern Cloud Apps
The Modern cloud apps Hackathon is a hands-on exercise that will challenge you to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Microsoft Azure App Services and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, security, and scale using various components of Microsoft Azure. 

Big Data & Visualization
AdventureWorks Travel (AWT) provides concierge services for business travelers. In an increasingly crowded market, they are always looking for ways to differentiate themselves and provide benefit to their corporate customers. 
They are looking to pilot a web-app that their internal customer service agents can use to provide additional information useful to the traveler during the flight booking process. They want to enable their agents to enter in the flight information and produce a prediction as to if the departing flight will encounter a 15-minute or longer delay, taking into account the weather forecasted for the departure hour. In this hackathon, attendees will build an end-to-end solution to predict flight delays taking into account the weather forecast.

Conatiners & DevOps
Fabrikam Medical Conferences provides conference web site services tailored to the medical community. They are refactoring their application code, which is based on node.js, so that it can run as a Docker application and want to implement a POC that will help them get familiar with the development process, lifecycle of deployment and critical aspects of the hosting environment. They will be deploying their applications to Azure Container Service based on Apache Mesos and want to be educated on how to deploy containers in a dynamically load balanced manner, discover containers, and scale them on demand. In this Hackathon, you will assist with completing this POC with a subset of the application code base. You will create a build agent based on Linux, and an Azure Container Service cluster for running deployed applications. You will be helping them to complete the Docker setup for their application, test locally, push to an image repository, deploy to the cluster, and test load balancing and scale. 

Database Upgrade & Migration
World Wide Importers is concerned about upgrading their database to SQL Server 2016 or Azure SQL DB.  The data warehouse has been successful for a long time.  As it has grown, it has filled with data, stored procedures, views, and security.  World Wide Importers wants assurance that if it moves its data store, it wonâ€™t run into any incompatibilities with the storage engine of SQL Server 2016.
She would like a POC of a data warehouse move and proof that the new technology will help ETL and query performance.

Intelligent Analytics
Adventure Works Travel specializes in building software solutions for the hospitality industry. Their latest product is an enterprise mobile/social chat product called Concierge+ (aka ConciergePlus). The mobile web app enables guests to easily stay in touch with the concierge and other guests, enabling greater personalization and improving their experience during their stay. Sentiment analysis is performed on top of chat messages as they occur, enabling hotel operators to keep tabs on guest sentiments in real-time. 

Microservices & Serverless
Contoso Events is an online service for concerts, sporting and other event ticket sales. They are redesigning their solution for scale with a microservices strategy and want to implement a POC for the path that receives the most traffic: ticket ordering.
In this hackathon, you will construct and load test an end-to-end POC for ticket ordering. You will leverage Service Fabric, API Management, Function Apps, Web Apps, Document DB, and Azure Active Directory B2C. 

Migrate EDW to Azure SQL Data Warehouse 
Coho has asked you to migrate an existing on-premises SQL Server data warehouse to Azure SQL Data Warehouse. To build out a viable solution that can replace the existing functionality of the on-premises system you will need to setup and configure an Azure SQL Data Warehouse, validate and migrate the existing data warehouse schema and data to Azure SQL Data Warehouse, and configure Power BI to access both the Azure SQL Data Warehouse and an existing on-premises OLTP sales database via Power BI Gateway.

Internet of Things
Fabrikam provides services and smart meters for enterprise energy (electrical power) management. There You-Left-The-Light-On service enables the enterprise to understand their energy consumption. In this Hackathon, you will construct an end-to-end solution for an IoT scenario that includes device management; telemetry ingest; hot and cold path processing; and reporting.

Vending Machines
Trey Research Inc. looks at the old way of doing things in retail and introduces innovative experiences that delight customers and drive sales. Their latest initiative focuses on intelligent vending machines that support commerce, engagement analytics, and intelligent promotions.
